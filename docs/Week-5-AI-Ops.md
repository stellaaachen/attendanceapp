# 5. AI Operations
This week we will work on testing and evaluating intelligent applications. This will build on your previous initial work on testing.

## Step 1. Generate a Fake Testing Database
Generate a fake testing database with fake courses, instructors, and students. Write a script to generate this database.

## Step 2. Gather a Dataset of "Real" Images.
You and your group should put together a dataset of at least 100 real images of QR codes. There are plenty of empty classrooms around campus that you can use to collect data. Use these images to generate the cheating scenarios we covered in the last week as well.  

## Step 3. Create a Test Suite
You will use this fake database to create a basic test suite.

### Step 3.1 Write a Plan (TODO)
1. What metrics should you measure to evaluate how accurate the system is?
2. How would you measure accuracy?
3. What limitations does your test suite have?

### Step 3.2 Ask Chat-GPT to Write a Plan (TODO)
Like we did earlier in this course, experiment with using Chat-GPT. By playing around with the prompts, ask Chat-GPT what metrics are worth measuring.

1. How does Chat-GPT differ from your plan?

### Step 3.3 Implement the Tests
How accurate is your system on each of the metrics.
