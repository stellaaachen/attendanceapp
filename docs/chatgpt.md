When we asked ChatGPT to generate an abstract SQL model, here's what it came up with:

### ChatGPT's data model
```SQL
CREATE TABLE user (
    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_type ENUM('instructor', 'student') NOT NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE course (
    course_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    course_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    instructor_id INT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (instructor_id) REFERENCES user(user_id)
);

CREATE TABLE student_course (
    student_id INT NOT NULL,
    course_id INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES user(user_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES course(course_id)
);

CREATE TABLE qr_code (
    qr_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    code VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at DATETIME NOT NULL,
    course_id INT NOT NULL,
    instructor_id INT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES course(course_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (instructor_id) REFERENCES user(user_id)
);

CREATE TABLE attendance (
    attendance_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT NOT NULL,
    qr_id INT NOT NULL,
    uploaded_at DATETIME NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES user(user_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (qr_id) REFERENCES qr_code(qr_id)
);
```

### Similarities:
1. Both ChaptGPT and us decided to make a user class and then use one variable to distinguish whether a user is instructor vs student
2. We both decided to divide the larger tables into smaller parts: courses, enrollment, qr code, etc., and thus having similar difficulties for implementing.

### Differences:
1. ChatGPT didn't keep track of some detailed information like the course's start and end dates (perhaps because it doesn't know if that's needed).
2. In the qr code table, ChatGPT has both course_id and instructor_id, whereas we only have course_id there because we think instructor_id is not necessarily directly linked to a QR code. In addition, we can get instructor_id from Course, so it's redundant.
3. ChatGPT's student vs instructor is ENUM while we had a boolean. This could be a better choice than ours because it better supports changes in the future, e.g. adding a new role like staff/TA, etc. However, since our current project specification only contains the two roles, it is unnecessary to worry about adding new roles, so our choice of using boolean, in some cases, is actually better in terms of saving more memory/disk space than using ENUM.
4. ChatGPT uses user_id, while we decided to use username as the primary key so once someone logs in with their username, we can track who they are very easily.  


**Overall, we would say both data models are pretty similar, and there are minor design choices which cause the differences.**
