1. About the code: I wrote this for a data engineering class I took 2 years ago. It is an attendance app for both students and professors to keep track of each class's attendance. We used a back end of SQLite to host it. Essentially, students and professors can create accounts with unique IDs, they can then create/add themselves to a class and for each session, there will be a QR code that is displayed so upon scanning the QR code the student will be marked for attendance. 

2. The instructions to run is in the Readme

3. The code does solve the problem, namingly, how to track attendance effectively without students cheating.

   I am very proud that I made both a front end and a back end for this so I learned how to connect our database to the front end and render that successfully. Additionally, I collaborated effectively with my teammate on this project and I think we had a very good division of labor which was great.

   Something that was slightly embarrassing was still the front end. I think it works well but we definitely could have designed it better and made it more aesthetic. The interface part was not a priority for us but in order to get users I think it is still critical.

   There are no bugs in the code however, I would like to think more broadly about how to scale the database since it was a very simple SQLite that cannot host a lot of data. So if we were to scale it up we'd have to find another database to host it.
   Another thing I wanted to learn more is how to make the application more secure. Right now there is a login feature but we don't have any protection against attacks so how to make the data more secure would be a next step.
